### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I am a motivated and forward-thinking individual with a strong foundation in AI and machine learning, currently in my last year of MSc in Bioinformatics. With hands-on experience in advanced algorithms and data analysis through projects such as AI-Nexus: SVM-Powered Attrition Forecasting and medical insurance cost prediction, I have developed technical skills in Python, SQL, DBMS and C++. Passionate about leveraging these skills to tackle complex challenge and drive innovation, I am eager to contribute to a dynamic environment where I can further develop my expertise in AI/ML and data science.
